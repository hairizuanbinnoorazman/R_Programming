This documents contains possible commands that can be used to further understand the data before starting modelling work etc.

Quick commands to get basic information regarding data.
Some things to probably to try to understand would be:
* Spread of the data
* Whether data has a lot outlier
* How does the each attribute in the data relate to each other and how they relate to the dependent variable

```{r}
str(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
range(mtcars$mpg)
IQR(mtcars$mpg)
quantile(mtcars$mpg)
quantile(mtcars$hp, probs = c(0.01, 0.99))
```

Plots made at this stage are mainly exploratory in nature. The faster to plot, the faster to understand the data

Some possible plots
```{r}
# Boxplot
boxplot(mtcars$disp, main = "Boxplot of displacement of mtcars", ylab = "cc")

# Histogram plot
hist(mtcars$disp, main = "Histogram of displacement of mtcars", xlab = "cc")
```
