This document contains sample code on using the caret package to run regression models on data.

As with every modelling project, there are several parts before building a model;
* Data Slicing (Spliting the data with at least a 70:30 ratio)

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
