## Data Slicing
This r markdown file contains information regarding the spliting of the initial datset to training and testing dataset (unless it is done for you already). Some of the ways of splitting the data would be a 7:3 ratio training:testing dataset but there are other ways of splitting the data as well such as bootstrapping and n-cross validation techniques.
